# The sound and vision of the slightly mad.

I feel as if I'm slowly floating downstream in a raft - a leisure raft filled with beer drinking, sun tanning, lazy calm summer down time.  As I look out ahead I see whitewater - rough, tumbling, dangerous change. I stiffen. I pull tight my life preserver. Behind me I hear a can of beer open. A laugh. A yawn. A giggle. The sun. Leisure. Everywhere. Rapids ahead - whitewater - brace yourselves.  A laugh, yawn, beer, laugh, beer, yawn, guitar (could be the shore, could be the raft behind).  Brace yourselves! The water is turning! A laugh.
