# Yes Indeed, Dr. Hunter S. Thompson Lives

Every once in a while it's a good idea to touch base with the things  in your life that have helped to craft the person you are.  For me one of those things is Hunter S. Thompson.  Reading his articles in Rolling Stone had a profound impact on the way I view the politics, culture and counter-culture of the USA.  I still have no idea  what made him kill himself the way he did, but at some level I certainly understand it.  I suppose that a lifetime of running in the opposite direction of the vast majority of folk you come by gets tiring.  In any event, I came across this video and remembered all over again what it was about Hunter that still lives on. <a href="http://www.mbfala.com/Thompson/Thompson_PR.html">And check this out too.</a> <a href="http://www.ammobooks.com/books/hst01/books_hst01.html">And this.</a>
