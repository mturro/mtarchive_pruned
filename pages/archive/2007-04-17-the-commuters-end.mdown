# The commuterâ€™s end

The heat came first... then the force. It came in a rush of white light and then dark.  It blew through him with the soft and comforting wind of a hair dryer and then turned quickly painful.  This is it... this is the fear they want you to feel... the fear they've been pounding on for the last five years... the fear that makes the apparatus grind and move.  This is the exact moment they kept telling me would come... the exact moment that budgets had been focused on... that wars have been fought over... that lives have been devoted to.  This exact moment in time, shared with these 17 people, was everything the last five years had been leading to.  This exact second brought everything into clear, undeniable focus.  This was the end.
