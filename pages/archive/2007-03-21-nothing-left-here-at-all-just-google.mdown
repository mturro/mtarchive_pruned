# Nothing left here at allâ€¦ just Google

It's a forbidding landscape this here country.  Speeding through it, looking at it through the train window at fifty miles an hour it really don't look like much, but trust me it is really god damned forbidding.  Take a look over there at that highway sign... it hasn't changed in over 20 years.  Whatever it was selling... whoever was selling it... the people responsible for that message... they're all gone.  Google it damn you... Google it and you'll see that they left with the first ship... left for the less forbidding country up there.  A whole crew of them never looked back... forgot all about their advertising campaigns, their brand message, their market segment... left it all to grow tall and wild out here in this forbidding country. Now it sits up there... that message... over grown and wild like some kind of crazy English garden.  Folks like you and me... us... we pass by it hundred at a time... some for years on end... cold days, warm days, nights, weekends, using our minutes to try and find somebody that might care... somebody that might be able to provide some kind of context.  Nobody.  Not a one.  There just isn't any context left in the Network.  It split on that first ship out. Nope.  Nothing left here at all... just Google.
