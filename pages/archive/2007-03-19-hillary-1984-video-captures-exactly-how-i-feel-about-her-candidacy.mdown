# Hillary 1984 video captures EXACTLY how I feel about her candidacy

While I am by no means an Obama man (personally I am hoping Gore runs), this video does do an excellent job of highlighting why I am uncomfortable with Ms. Clinton as a candidate.  It's not so much that I don't agree with her on the issues as it's the feeling that she's too inside... too much a part of the way things are when we really need someone who sees the entrenched problems we face.  We have to break free of this infantile Bush-Clinton cycle and start looking for someone who is not a so caught up in the machine (or, in the case of Mr. Gore, someone who has been eaten up by the machine, survived, and fundamentally transformed).  And in case you don't recognize the base material here it's Apple's 1984 ad introducing the Macintosh... thus the "Vote Different" title and the Apple/Obama logo at the end.
