# '2012'

There is a point in time... in the future... in five years... a point that steadily and forcefully draws near.  A point that almost nobody realizes is significant.  A point that crystalizes everything into a simple, easy to understand moment.  A point that ancient shamans have visited thousands of times... surfing through time... finding cosmic strings that vibrate forgiveness and pity.  There is a point in time... a point that radiates and devours hope simultaneously. A point that planets have been shifting toward... a point that writers have sifted through language, painters have distilled into color, and filmmakers have realized in motion.  There is a point in time... a point that lives in both physical and spiritual realms... a point that science and philosophy have built into theory... a point that markets organically calibrate themselves to.  There is a point in time... a cambrian leap... an evolution... a point that we are (to borrow a phrase) slouching toward... waiting to be born.
