# power failure

The energy is dwindling into nothing... it is sapped and gone... thirty percent and falling fast.  HE tried to think... tried to get a solution... a fix... away out but he couldn't get past everything that HE had been up to now.  HE couldn't leave behind outdated modes of being in order to save himself... HE couldn't even though HE knew HE had to...  HE had to adapt... Twenty-five percent... HE saw it all the way... HE had watched it coming from about ten miles out.... HE had no excuse and now HE was very close to nothing.  HE struggled for a moment and grunted against the useless weight of everything that was happening... CRITICAL STAGE... RESERVE POWER... HE closed his eyes and then quickly opened them realizing HE had been wondering about this moment for along time and HE wanted to see it... to know who might be right... and that was all the power HE had left.
