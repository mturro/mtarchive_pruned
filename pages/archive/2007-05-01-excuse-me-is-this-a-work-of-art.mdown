# Excuse me, is this a work of art?

http://www.youtube.com/v/V3Nha7gHGqQ

Found this video (by <a href="http://www.youtube.com/anavelez76">Ana Velez</a>) via the <a href="http://woostercollective.com">Wooster Collective</a> feed... it does a great job at poking fun at and underscoring the absurdity of modern, Dadaist, avant-garde art. This video brought to mind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcel_Duchamp">Marcel Duchamp</a> and his idea that:

<blockquote>The creative act is not performed by the artist alone; the spectator brings the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its inner qualifications and thus adds his contribution to the creative act.</blockquote>

This idea certainly extends beyond the world of Art and can encompass any creative act... right now I am especially thinking of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_Barthes">Roland Barthes</a> and his notions on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_the_Author">the death of the author</a>.
