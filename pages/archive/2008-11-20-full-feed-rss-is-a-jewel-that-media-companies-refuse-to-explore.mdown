# Full-feed RSS is a jewel that media companies refuse to explore

<p><a href="http://www.thepomoblog.com/archive/full-feed-rss-is-a-jewel-that-media-companies-refuse-to-explore/">Let me add this item to the short list of things I'll say amen to.</a>  I'm a voracious RSS consumer - my reading list stands at 577 feeds as I write this - and nothing chaps my ass more than having to click out of my reader and over to a the actual site to read a full item - especially if I'm reading feeds on my phone.  Granted, it is kind of nice to get a whiff of the originating sites design and original context, but more often than not I'll just skip over partial feeds - unless they are so intriguing that I just HAVE to jump.  When I'm in flow - scan - read - mode I just want ingest and progress - not jump. Jumping is for browsing - for when I'm looking for new feeds - full feeds.
