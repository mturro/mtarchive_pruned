# A response to a response to a response of @khoi on iPad magazines

<div class="Amp_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Post_Text"><p>There is indeed a misunderstanding at work here, but I think it's spencerotica who is misunderstanding my point in response to Khoi's post (which does in fact question the relevance of the "mode of reading the a magazine represents").  As you correctly state a magazine "will never be able to match the depth or personalization of a social aggregation tool" â€“ but that's kind of my point. Magazines aren't highly personalized and that's a good thing. They represent a coherent point of view - a potential counterfactual that is even more necessary in an information environment that is predisposed to confirmation bias. The disintegrated, pick and choose flow of digital media is a wonderful thing (I live in Google Reader/Feedly and scan the feeds of 1135 blogs every day), but we lose something when we always play the single and forget that it's actually part of an album. When we confine our intellectual investigation to a parade of fragmented ideas we are abdicating the true value inherent in the integrated whole.  Ultimately it's not about whether magazines are better than social aggregation or RSS - its about the fact that they are different in a very important and often overlooked way.</p></div></div><div class="Amp_Content_Outer"><div class="Amp_Top_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Source_First"><span>Amplify&rsquo;d from <a rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://spencerotica.tumblr.com/post/1426851804" href="http://spencerotica.tumblr.com/post/1426851804">spencerotica.tumblr.com</a></span></div></div><div class="Amp_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote class="Amp_Content_Item" cite="http://spencerotica.tumblr.com/post/1426851804"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><h1 id="AutoGeneratedID-0">@Mike Turro&#8217;s Beautiful Misunderstanding</h1></td></tr></table></blockquote><div class="Amp_Content_Hr"></div><blockquote class="Amp_Content_Item" cite="http://spencerotica.tumblr.com/post/1426851804"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div id="AutoGeneratedID-2"><p id="AutoGeneratedID-1"><a rel="nofollow"  href="http://www.subtraction.com/2010/10/27/my-ipad-magazine-stand">Yesterday</a>, designer Khoi Vin argued that, fundamentally, the publishing industry&#8217;s &#8220;experimentation&#8221; with converting print magazine&#8217;s to iPad apps is wrongheaded and doomed for failure. Beyond usability issues (no social sharing, no integrated subscription models, etc.), he argued that there is no future in recreating yesterday&#8217;s experiences on tomorrow&#8217;s technology.</p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this argument is fairly vague, and I think that has led to some <a rel="nofollow"  href="http://mturro.amplify.com/2010/10/28/khoi-vinns-beautiful-mistake/">misunderstanding</a>. Nowhere is Vin railing against the <em>reading </em>experience of print magazines. Instead, he finds fault with the idea that any app sandboxed against the world could be successful in the long term. No matter how well-produced a magazine is, it will never be able to match the depth or personalization of a social aggregation tool. What happens when a Netflix-like app for <em>magazine articles</em>&#160;is created?</p></div><span class="Amp_Source_Button"><a rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://spencerotica.tumblr.com/post/1426851804" href="http://spencerotica.tumblr.com/post/1426851804">Read more at spencerotica.tumblr.com</a></span></td></tr></table></blockquote></div><div class="Amp_Bottom_Wrap">&nbsp;</div></div><div class="Amp_Link">See this Amp at <a href="http://amplify.com/u/ebdl">http://amplify.com/u/ebdl</a></div><br/>
