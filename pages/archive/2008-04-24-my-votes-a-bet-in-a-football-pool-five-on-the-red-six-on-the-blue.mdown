# My vote's a bet in a football pool, five on the red, six on the blue.

Wake up fool there's  no time for a shouting match.  That's the next line after the headline of this post as it sits in <a href="http://www.mikedoughty.com/">Mike Doughty's</a>  sublime anti-war tune <a href="http://www.mikedoughty.com/music/lyrics/117">Fort Hood</a>.  Embedded above is the newly released video for that sweet, sorrowful, hopeful song. It's up on Youtube and it should be shared.  But why sit here and read my words on it when the author of the tune sums it up so well:

<blockquote>
<a href="http://www.mikedoughty.com/blog/archives/000745.html">Actually, by posting it here, and making it available on YouTube, and embeddable, we're bumming the record company out. They liked it when we showed it to them, and wanted to coordinate a whole marketing and radio campaign about it. We were going to wait, and let them do their thing, but I watched the primary last night, and hearing Obama and Hillary snark at each other while this terrible nightmare is still going on, I realized I didn't want to wait.</a>

No time for a shouting match indeed.
