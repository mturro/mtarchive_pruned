# The sliding snow makes life alive

Coagulation... the stickiness of the blood of people driving into one another, jammed into small space.  As the snow falls many things start to become normal... things that slid into nowhere a short while ago are now sliding into each other.  That's alright.  Some people need to slide into each other... some Bluetooth nightmares can't continue unless they slide into somebody totally unlike themselves.  They need that crash to connect... like the movie says.  They need to meet the parts of themselves that they never get to see. The sliding snow makes that happen. It brings itself, white, into the gray weekday, bringing with it new patterns of thought.  It brings itself, cold, into the warm jelly of mind, firing up new and ancient nodes.  It brings itself, sliding, into the abnormally stuck and broken routine of everyday, warning of the dangers of stagnation.  The sliding snow makes life alive.
