OK... so I am a bit partial to this video because I make a brief appearance (a much younger me, but me nonetheless), but it is truly one of my favorite tunes regardless.  William just keeps churning out good music, good visuals, and good fun... I strongly urge anyone and everyone to <a href="http://fuzzontheapple.com">check him out</a>.  He is the real deal people!!! (And mad respect to his partner in crime - Jess - you make him better).
