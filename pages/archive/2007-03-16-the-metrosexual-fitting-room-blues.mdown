# The metrosexual fitting room blues

The clothes didn't fit him in quite the manner he had hoped. They were mysteriously baggy in places that he felt himself to be the largest and surprisingly tight in the areas in which he had hoped he was trim.  He couldn't explain it.  He wanted to think that he knew himself but this is exactly the kind of thing that called into question every long-standing belief about himself he has ever held. He sat there in the yellow light absorbing the reflection from large mirror... trying desperately to understand it, to make sense of it.  In some objective sense he recognized the reflection as the same one that had greeted him that very morning in his bathroom, but here, inside this fitting room, he couldn't help but feel disconnected from the image.  It didn't feel like him... looking at the image didn't make him feel like he wanted to feel... it didn't make him feel happy... not like the image outside the fitting room... the one on the wall... next to the rack where he took these clothes from... that image was happy... this one was simply depressing.
