# Marco Roth writing for @nplusonemag on history, victimhood, race, and the tea
  party.

<div class="Amp_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Post_Text"><p>Marco Roth at n+1 magazine on the culture of victimization that fuels what he sees as the latent racism of the tea party movement. Not that I go in much for the broad brush approach to analyzing political movements, but he does a great job of explicating the ways in which the tropes the Tea Party uses have been used by ethno-nationalist movements throughout American history.</p></div></div><div class="Amp_Content_Outer"><div class="Amp_Top_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Source_First"><span>Amplify&rsquo;d from <a rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://nplusonemag.com/causcasian-nation" href="http://nplusonemag.com/causcasian-nation">nplusonemag.com</a></span></div></div><div class="Amp_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote class="Amp_Content_Item" cite="http://nplusonemag.com/causcasian-nation"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><p id="AutoGeneratedID-0">But it&#8217;s futile to insist on nuances of history and law when we&#8217;re speaking the language of &#8220;offense.&#8221; The mythical heartland Sarah Palin speaks from, or for, is full of these voiceless, downtrodden plain folk who are constantly being offended, for whom there is no end to the offenses, real or imagined, perpetrated against them: the Mexican immigrant speaking his native tongue, the Muslim at his prayers, the black man drinking from a public water fountain (oh wait, that one&#8217;s not offensive anymore . . .). One of the more charming stories in Budiansky&#8217;s history of Reconstruction concerns a Southern gentleman who wanted a freed slave whipped because he had the temerity to wish him &#8220;good morning&#8221; without being spoken to first. These offended people see with such dreadful clarity things that don&#8217;t exist, and so remake reality to suit their grievances.</p></td></tr></table></blockquote><div class="Amp_Content_Hr"></div><blockquote class="Amp_Content_Item" cite="http://nplusonemag.com/causcasian-nation"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><p id="AutoGeneratedID-1">Of course, the majority of white Americans, like the majority of all other kinds of Americans, have good reason to feel aggrieved. They are the victims of bad economic and foreign policies; their state budgets are crippled by debts, their federal legislature is paralyzed, environmental catastrophe stalks their shores, oceans, and atmosphere. But when they go to the polls in November, if they go at all, a fair number of them will cast their vote on the basis of who stood up for them against imaginary Muslim hordes invading lower Manhattan to pray to their terrorist God.</p><span class="Amp_Source_Button"><a rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://nplusonemag.com/causcasian-nation" href="http://nplusonemag.com/causcasian-nation">Read more at nplusonemag.com</a></span></td></tr></table></blockquote></div><div class="Amp_Bottom_Wrap">&nbsp;</div></div><div class="Amp_Link">See this Amp at <a href="http://amplify.com/u/dyry">http://amplify.com/u/dyry</a></div><br/>
