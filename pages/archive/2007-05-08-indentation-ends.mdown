# indentation ends

He sat and wondered about indentation... the little space at the beginning of a paragraph that had started to disappear somewhere around 1996.  He still sees it in books and printed pages, but he so rarely reads trees that it's like the convention has all but disappeared. He's not really upset about it and there is pretty much zero likelihood that he'll mount any sort of comeback movement... there's just no zeitgeist for old school typesetting technique and he kind of likes the skip a line style that has become prevalent in the digital world.  It seems more natural to him... more of a delineation of ideas... more of a separation of thought from one paragraph to the next.  In the digital world the paragraph has become much more autonomous... at home in a larger body of text, but open to extraction... to block-quote... to inclusion in some relevant search result somewhere.  Information is being atomized and the paragraph is a prime component in the de/re-construction of text.  He sat and still wondered about his place in that mix... about his part in the persistent transformation of ideas... about where he will fit when this moment is taken and mixed and made into the pure information that god/nature intended this-him to be.
