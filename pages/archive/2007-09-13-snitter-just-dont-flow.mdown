# Snitter Just Donâ€™t Flow

I momentarily tried the Twitter client <a href="http://snook.ca/snitter/">Snitter</a> today.  For those of you who are not familiar with twitter, shame: go now[<a href="http://twitter.com">http://twitter.com</a>.]  I was kind of pulled in to trying it by a few different <a href="http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2007/09/air.html">posts</a>, but the one that got me was <a href="http://twitter.com/stoweboyd/statuses/266236932">Stowe Boyd's tweet</a> that he was dumping <a href="http://iconfactory.com/software/twitterrific">Twitterific</a> - the app I have been using.  I like his ideas on flow and am always willing to follow his lead...  AND <em>I am</em> kind of interested in playing with <a href="http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/air/">Adobe's AIR</a> - so I jumped in.

Anyway, I like it... it's great how you can easily direct tweet people and I love how it gives both real and screen names of the people you follow, but (and this surprises me a bit) it just doesn't flow for me.  My problem is actually more with AIR than Snitter though.  I like to keep Twitterific running hidden and let <a href="http://growl.info/">Growl</a> or the menubar tell me when new tweets are in.  AIR can't integrate with Growl so I was kind of lost and found myself having to manually check Snitter rather than tweets just flowing to me like with Twitterific.

So while Stowe may be saying goodbye to Twitterific, I think I'll stay put... at least until AIR gets some Growl integration going.
