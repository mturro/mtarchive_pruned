# Meaningless Text?

So this post is really not much in the way of a post as it is a test.  You see I'm writing this from an OS X dashboard widget rather than the usual Wordpress admin screen.  The implications in this are of course that this will let me post more often, yet the posts will most likely not be terrificly thought out.  I'm going to try and write more like a traditional "blogger" rather than the sort of careful, journalistic  writing that I'm used to.  Raw thought.  It'll be interesting for me at least, and perhaps if you read this site more regularly it might be interesting for you as well.  We'll all just have to wait and see.
