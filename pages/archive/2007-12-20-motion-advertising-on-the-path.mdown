This short clip is my second contribution to the collaborative web film project <a href="http://passingby.net">Passing By</a>.  It is taken from the PATH train that links Hoboken and Manhattan and focuses on the everybody's favorite: the motion advertising on the tunnel wall between the 14th and 23rd street stations.
