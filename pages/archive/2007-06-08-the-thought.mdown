# the thought

He stood looking out into the dessert with only one thought on his mind... He stood on the top of the building with only one thought on his mind... He stood on the edge of the bridge with only one thought in his mind... He stood in the market with only one thought on his mind... He stood in the middle of the diamond with only one thought on his mind... He stood on the train platform with only one thought on his mind... He stood in the open field with only one thought on his mind... He stood at the edge of the beach with only one thought on his mind... He stood on the rocky cliff with only one thought on his mind... He stood on the podium with only one thought on his mind... He stood upright in his seat with only one thought on his mind... He stood at the tee with only one thought on his mind... He stood in the intersection with only one thought on his mind... He stood behind the register with only one thought on his mind... He stood over the stove with only one thought on his mind... He stood at the foul line with only one thought in his mind.  He stood, finally, looking down into the freshly dug grave, stark and empty, nothing in his mind, as the thought, for its part, stood singular, alone, shimmering, completely untouchable.
