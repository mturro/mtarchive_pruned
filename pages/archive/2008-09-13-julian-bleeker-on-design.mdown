# Julian Bleeker on Design

One of the questions that I wrestle with is the question of design - what it is, what it means, what place does it have in an increasingly engineered and technical data-centric atmosphere?  For me and my main area of interest - the evolution of the magazine and magazine publishing - this is a particularly interesting series of questions.  If the current upheaval in print media is anything it is indeed a revolution in design and the necessary design thinking that accompanies it.

In the following video Julian Bleeker - design researcher in Nokia's Design Strategic Projects Studio and co-founder with Nicolas Nova of the Near Future Laboratory - explores these questions and how it's crucial for the modern designer to understand how design is implemented.
