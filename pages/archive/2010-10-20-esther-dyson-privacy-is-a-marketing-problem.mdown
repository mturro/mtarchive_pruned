# ! 'Esther Dyson: Privacy is a marketing problem...'

<div class="Amp_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Post_Text"><p>This is so incredibly simple and obvious it's amazing that it's not really common practice. It highlights the extent to which marketing communications is still mired in the demographically driven, generationally directed, yet hopelessly opaque bulk mindset of the previous century. Not sure if it's because crafting more personal communication is perceived as too complexâ€“or perhaps too creepy? I mean if Facelessbook starts talking to me like they are actually one of my friends I'm not sure that it screams "we respect your privacy" in the way Dyson would hope it might.</p></div></div><div class="Amp_Content_Outer"><div class="Amp_Top_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Source_First"><span>Amplify&rsquo;d from <a rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://gigaom.com/2010/10/19/esther-dyson-privacy-is-a-marketing-problem/" href="http://gigaom.com/2010/10/19/esther-dyson-privacy-is-a-marketing-problem/">gigaom.com</a></span></div></div><div class="Amp_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote class="Amp_Content_Item" cite="http://gigaom.com/2010/10/19/esther-dyson-privacy-is-a-marketing-problem/"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><p id="AutoGeneratedID-0">Know your customer, and talk to that person as an individual, not as someone in a bucket. Don&#8217;t talk to them as &#8216;Millennials,&#8217; talk to them as &#8216;You, Joe, who checked in at Times Square last week.&#8217; Take that same consumer intelligence, take that same creativity, take that same ability to personalize and apply it to these people&#8217;s data. Explain to them what you know about them in a personal way, in a way they can understand. And then they will trust you; they will make up their minds do we want the free content or not, but it will be a genuinely two-way transaction where there&#8217;s real disclosure and real consent. It&#8217;s shocking to me that with all the creativity in this industry we can&#8217;t figure out how to explain to our own customers what it is we&#8217;re doing to them and have them genuinely part of the conversation rather than watching them from behind the two-way mirror.</p><span class="Amp_Source_Button"><a rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://gigaom.com/2010/10/19/esther-dyson-privacy-is-a-marketing-problem/" href="http://gigaom.com/2010/10/19/esther-dyson-privacy-is-a-marketing-problem/">Read more at gigaom.com</a></span></td></tr></table></blockquote></div><div class="Amp_Bottom_Wrap">&nbsp;</div></div><div class="Amp_Link">See this Amp at <a href="http://bit.ly/cjJE8X">http://bit.ly/cjJE8X</a></div><br/>
