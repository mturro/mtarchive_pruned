Let's suppose that Barack Obama can ride this wave straight out of Iowa and into the general election.  Imagine, if you will, the tone of that campaign... the tensions it will ignite... the ways it will expose the cultural, social and religious divisions that have been slowly pulling at the seams of the American experiment since it's inception.  An Obama candidacy has the potential to tear those seams - to bring the festering clash of red and blue to the fore in a way that no presidential election ever really has.  Maybe Obama can show us just how ugly we are... how much hate, fear, and ultimately, how much hope lies dormant in the great American wilderness. This could be it America... this could be the big one.
