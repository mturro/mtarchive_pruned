# Why Michael Pollan is the most subversive writer alive.

<div class="Clog_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Clog_Post_Text"><p>While most food and diet books focus on you - on how to make you look better, make you feel better, make you a more happy and loved person, make you look good on the beach, get you more dates - Michael Pollan focuses on us.  It&#8217;s that simple little shift of focus (from me to we) that takes Pollan&#8217;s message out of the realm of self-help and into the world of subversive, political, anti-establishment activism. In exposing our food chain for the diseased, corrupt, polluting, corporate, calorie making assault on natural ecological process that it is Pollan has successfully tied our own personal health to the overall health of society.  In tying the well being of the planet, our society, our economy, and our culture to the well being of people as individuals he has bridged the gap between self interest and saving the world.  For the first time in a long time it would appear that well being and social activism share the same methodology.</p></div></div><div class="Clog_Content_Outer"><!-- BEGIN_CLOG_CONTENT ID: C3C5E052-71B3-4D92-B110-2F677CF87501 CLOGS.CLIPMARKS.COM --><div class="Clog_Top_Wrap"><div class="Clog_Source_First"><span>Clipped from <a rel="clipsource"  title="http://vimeo.com/7528069" href="http://vimeo.com/7528069">vimeo.com</a></span></div></div><div class="Clog_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote class="Clog_Content_Item" cite="http://vimeo.com/7528069"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div align="center" class="Clog_Content_Item_Emb"><embed src="http://vimeo.com/moogaloop_local.swf?ver=32531" height="329" width="400" wmode="opaque" allowfullscreen="true" allowscriptaccess="always" bgcolor="#ffffff" flashvars="clip_id=7528069&amp;server=vimeo.com&amp;autoplay=0&amp;fullscreen=1&amp;md5=0&amp;show_portrait=0&amp;show_title=0&amp;show_byline=0&amp;context=|newest&amp;context_id=&amp;force_embed=0&amp;multimoog=&amp;color=00ADEF&amp;force_info=undefined" id="vimeo_clip_7528069" type="application/x-shockwave-flash"></embed></div><span class="Clog_Source_Button"><a rel="clipsource"  title="http://vimeo.com/7528069" href="http://vimeo.com/7528069">See more at vimeo.com</a></span></td></tr></table></blockquote></div><div class="Clog_Bottom_Wrap">&nbsp;</div></div>
