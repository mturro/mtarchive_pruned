# Endorsed by Mike Doughty

Whenever Mike Doughty endorses something I always like to check it out.  And since I'm not feeling well and just want to get something out into the ether I figured I'd pass this on to you.  It's a video by Swedish singer/songwriter Jose Gonzales.  As I said up top, I'm getting this from Mike Doughty's blog... if you don't know Mike, his blog or his music, <a href="http://www.mikedoughty.com/blog/archives/000703.html">please check him out as well</a>.
