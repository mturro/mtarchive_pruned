# Hospital WiFi

<p>Faced with the prospect of spending hours and hours over the next day or so at Hackensack University Medical Center (supporting the mother-in-law), I held tightly to the hope that I might also experience the good fortune that Jon Udell blogged about in this post from a few weeks back: <a href="http://blog.jonudell.net/2007/06/14/exeter-hospital-gets-wifi-right/#comments">(Exeter Hospital gets WiFi right)</a>.   Well I am happy to report that I am in fact writing and posting this from the hospital connection!  Thank you HUMC! Now I can actually pretend like I'm not here... or something like that.</p>
