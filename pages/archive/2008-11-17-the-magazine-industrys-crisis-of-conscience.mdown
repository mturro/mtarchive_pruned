# The Magazine Industry's Crisis of Conscience

<a href="http://www.portfolio.com/views/blogs/mixed-media/2008/11/17/the-magazine-industrys-crisis-of-conscience?tid=true">ASME are really just killing themselves here.</a>  When it comes to choosing between making a living or getting an ASME Award most folks will probably choose the food.  Ultimately the guidelines need to loosen - it's not the same world it was when these guidelines were initially conceived. Readers today are more savvy and have more tools at their disposal to investigate and root out insincere or corrupt editorial.  Going forward readers will care less about whether an economic relationship exists between publisher and product and more about whether the information they are getting is good.  In the past the guidelines helped assure readers that was indeed the case. Increasingly they don't need or very much want or even trust the editorial assurances of the quality of the info - they'll vet it themselves, thank you very much.  Power to the readers.
