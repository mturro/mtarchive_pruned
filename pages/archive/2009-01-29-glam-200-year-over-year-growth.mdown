# ! 'Glam: 200% Year-Over-Year Growth'

<p><a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2009/1/glam-claims-200-year-over-year-growth">Glam: 200% Year-Over-Year Growth</a> - This post at the Silicon Alley Insider caught my eye - mainly because I have long thought that the route that Glam Media has chosen is perhaps the most logical and potentially profitable route open to print media publishers whose revenue is driven by ad sales.  Personally I just don't see the wisdom of outsourcing ad sales to networks (for an interesting discussion on that subject see <a href="http://www.alleyinsider.com/2009/1/why-ad-rates-are-plummeting-and-what-it-means-nyt">this post</a> - also at the Insider).  Ad sales and service is a core strength for a lot of traditional publishers - it is their lifeblood.  To farm that out simply because the tech is different or more complicated seems to me to be an abdication of a core competence. Ad driven publishers should be going in the other direction. Like Glam they should devote resources to building a network of publishing partners for whom ad sales and service is a burden (like bloggers). Like Glam ad driven publishers should realize and embrace that what they do best - what has paid their bills - is the sale and service of advertising.
