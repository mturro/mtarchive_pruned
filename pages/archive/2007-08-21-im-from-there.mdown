# Iâ€™m From There

I started reading Fred Turner's book <i><a href="http://www.librarything.com/work.php?book=19843162">From Counterculture to Cyberculture: Stewart Brand, the Whole Earth Network, and the Rise of Digital Utopianism</a></i> and I am amazed at how I continuously find my way back to the same story.  Not EXACTLY the same story of course, but a fair approximation of the old hippie mystique... the zeitgeist of the world I was born into on July 15, 1969. In some way I feel as if that era is my era... that it somehow has played a pivotal role in making me who I am.  I wasn't born on a commune.  My parents weren't hippies.  I have no real connection to any of it other than my first breaths on earth were drawn in waning moments of that cultural upheaval and maybe, somehow, it rubbed off on me.

In reading the book it has occurred to me that the transition that Turner documents mirrors, quite remarkably, my own personal transformation from hippie-slacker to the technology professional you read here now.   I guess it just goes to show you that our influences are, more often than we might expect, subconsciously gathered.
