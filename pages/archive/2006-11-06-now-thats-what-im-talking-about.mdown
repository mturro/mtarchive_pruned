# Now THAT’s what I’m Talking About

My last post on magazine publishing attempted to crystalize some of the things I have been feeling about my chosen profession... the magazine business.  That post, which hailed the <a href="http://www.bluepear.org/main/index.php/archives/45">death of publishing</a>, hinted at some of the things I've been sensing without really nailing them.  Lucky for me I'm not the only one who is thinking in the magazine world and so I will now provide you with a link to a very insightful essay by Derek Powazek, the Editor of <a href="http://jpgmag.com/">JPG Magazine</a>, on how magazines, which are traditionally three separate communities, need to start thinking of themselves as one.  Simple really... and in the same neighborhood as my thinking... <a href="http://www.8020publishing.com/blog/2006/10/three_communities.html">but this is a bit more focused.  Enjoy!</a>
