# Now is everything

Non sequential advisories for the eastern coast have been issued and they can't be taken back... the cat's already out of the god-damned bag and it's not going to be collected again... not without a fight.  Jim told me that the blues always played at sunrise... just wasn't that many folks up to hear them.  There was a lot of folks today though... everybody was wide wake and waiting.  They saw the ships first and then the light... inverted... came from just above them.  The sailors were all out of uniform, letting their pale blue skin fester in the new and alien sunlight.  They had traveled... it seemed like a billion miles in nanoseconds... time and distance had been conquered though... they were inter-dimensional.  All this time they had been right there... living in parallel... molecularly co-mingled with the rich, the poor, the sad, the happy, the styrofoam.  We couldn't see them, but when they were discovered... when it was discovered... when we all were discovered... it made terrific sense.  The past, the present and the future all happening at the same time all just being... this was that little something that everyone felt... that everyone knew... now is everything.
