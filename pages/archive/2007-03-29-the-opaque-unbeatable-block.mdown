# The opaque unbeatable block

He sat staring at the big wooden block.  It was daunting in its emptiness... large, square, brown, empty.  He had tried to maneuver past it, work his way around it, find some way through it, but it was no use... the block was there.  He decided to walk up to it... to knock on its hard face.. to get to know it... to understand exactly what it was about the block that made it so god-damned insurmountable.  He tried to see the block... truly see it for the first time.  He tried to get beyond the idea of it as a block and start to see it an atomic level... as little particles or strings or anything other than a big solid mass of inflexible, unworkable block.  No go.  Nothing he did could get him around the obstruction... it was there and he had to now live his life on its terms.  The very idea made him shudder.  No more family, no more friends, no more conversation.  Nothing would ever be for him again.  Nothing but this big, unmoving, inflexible, solid mass of a block. As he started to imagine this life... to accept it.. he started to see something strange.  He saw light... and for the  first time it wasn't light that fell upon the block, but it was light that shone through it.  He, for the first time in hours, let a grin flash across his face.  The block... the opaque, unbeatable block, was starting to shine.
