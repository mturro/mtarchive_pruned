Could this display by apparently sexist young men really have been staged by Clinton supporters?  Could the whole "change" thing - as empty as it may be - have pushed her into an "oh yeah" moment in which she realized that she is actually treading on historic ground herself?  Could she be cleverly riding the cultural moment and adjusting in real time? Who knows?  What I do know is that her numbers among women killed her in Iowa. What I do know is that over the last few days in New Hampshire Senator Clinton has <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MVlwH7-05Fk">softened and become vulnerable and has played more womanly</a>.  What I do know is that women went for her in a big way in New Hampshire.  And finally, what i do know, is that the results in New Hampshire sure look a lot like women coming to the defense of a historic campaign.
