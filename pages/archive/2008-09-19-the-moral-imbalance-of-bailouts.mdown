# The moral imbalance of bailouts

Love this from Jeff Jarvis: "Perhaps every sick person without insurance should march on Washington to show that theyâ€™re a big disaster, too. Perhaps they should add up the impact of their illnesses on the economy to prove their financial weight. To expose the moral relativism of our collective national view of tragedy and obligation, maybe they should put up signs on their homes and wear badges that say, 'Bail me out.'"
