# The Bandwidth of Books

<a href="http://www.designobserver.com/archives/024858.html">This article by Alice Twemlow (found at Design Observer)</a> is an interesting read that touches on the sometime over-analyzed but always necessary debate on the friction between digital and print media. Written in response to her visit to the current <a href="http://www.artistsspace.org/">Artists Space</a> exhibition <a href="http://www.artistsspace.org/exhibitions/current.html">KIOSK (XIX) – Modes of Multiplication</a> (curated by <a href="http://www.revolver-books.de/">Christoph Keller</a>)  the article, as well as the exhibition, focuses on the continuing growth of the contemporary art press in the face of declining readership and increasing digital media choices.  The counter-intuitive thrust of the situation highlights the ways in which print (ink on paper) could continue to be a cultural (or maybe sub-cultural) player for a long time to come.  Perhaps the most telling passage in the piece is this bit:


<blockquote>The creators of such publications do not expect large readerships — nor do they depend upon sales. Instead their enterprises are funded by subsidies in Europe and in the U.S. many have opted for non-profit status. As Keller has pointed out, “All these art books would cost a fortune if they were rooted in a capitalistic market system… Of the 500 books I have published with Revolver, more than half the copies have been given away or swapped for other books.”</blockquote>

That these books are existing and exchanged outside the capitalist market system would seem to indicate that print is in trouble as a commercial mass medium, but has a bright and comfortable future in niche markets where the aesthetic cache of ink on paper still holds sway.
