# notes out of order

...the scandal is life really... the way it breaks and manipulates... the development of its characters... the shattering of soul into individual psyche... the relentless posturing of ego... each of us autonomous, fractured, opaque gaps... information congealed... clots of the free roaming brought together under terrific stress... we form like diamonds... soiled by the weight of things... driven by the complicated rhythms of distant music... we grope and stab and bleed for accumulated matter... ruthless and cruel but tragically sincere... consumption reels us in wiggling on the end of a pointed and painful line... desire and youth taunt us... loneliness defines us...  simplicity escapes us... love saves us.
