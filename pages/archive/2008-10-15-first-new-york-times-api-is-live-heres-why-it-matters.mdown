# First New York Times API is Live - Here's Why it Matters

Marshall Kirkpatrick has this brief post on ReadWriteWeb about the New York Times API.  He sees it as a ground breaking step in the transition of established media companies into new modes of operation and I enthusiastically agree with him.  If these organizations are going to thrive in the new world they are going to have to open the windows and let in the light - they are going to have to let outside developers have access to their databases - they are going to have to set their information free.  While there will always be a place for traditionally contextualized content designed for human consumption it's the chunked data, the query ready, application oriented content that will determine the 21st Century publisher's reach.
