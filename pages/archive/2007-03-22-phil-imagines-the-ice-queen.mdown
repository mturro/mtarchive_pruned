# Phil Imagines The Ice Queen

ICE QUEEN.  Phil sat and imagined exactly the situation that could provide the motivation for someone to scribble that phrase onto the back of a train seat.  Just by reading it he seemed to know exactly what inspired the act.  Phil imagined the author coming home from class... a budding engineer traveling between home and tech... having just gotten a sub-par grade on a project... feeling frustrated and unsure of his chosen path in life... feeling obliged to take that frustration out on the back of this seat.  The seat that Phil now sat behind.  The seat Phil was stuck staring at for forty-five minutes.  ICE QUEEN.  Probably a reference to the author's professor... she wouldn't bend, wouldn't give a micron in giving out her grade.  She just gave the author a cold blank stare.  ICE QUEEN.  He tried to melt that gaze... flowers... candy... lingerie... but that only got him written up by the university police.  ICE QUEEN.  He tried to appeal to her sense of social indignation... his great, great, great grandmother was half Cherokee... his people had suffered enough.  ICE QUEEN.  He tried to compare himself to others in the class... James didn't even bother to prototype for Christ's sake.  ICE QUEEN.  The grade was final... he would get a C... AVERAGE... BECAUSE... OF... THE... FUCKING... ICE QUEEN. Phil smiled.
