# Can Engagement Really Become the New Standard?

<a href="http://www.socialtimes.com/2008/08/can-engagement-really-become-the-new-standard/">Nick O'Neill of The Social Times isn't exactly digging real deep here</a>, but he's asking all the right questions.  To my way of thinking there are two opportunities in online advertising. The first and most widely known is capturing the user in "buy mode" - getting your product in front of users precisely at the moment they are looking to buy it.  Google owns this space now and for the foreseeable future.  The other is more elusive - it's how the user interacts with your brand when they're not buying.  They could be doing research or review or just blowing hot air, but managing how your brand plays in that space - in the social space - is the key here.  Engagement starts to address that - reputation - image - who's talking, when, and how often.  Measure that reliably and you have something.
