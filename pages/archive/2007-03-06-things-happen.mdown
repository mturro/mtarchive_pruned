# Things Happen

When things happen they happen for a reason... or at least some people feel that way.  The truth is, you never can tell what or when or where something will happen... there is usually very little reason behind most happenings.  They just happen... a million times  second all over the world.  Things happen in taxis in hotels in restaurants in shops in parks in offices in subways in transience of all forms.  Things happen when nobody is looking and when the entire world watches.  Things happen as trains pull into their stations and as the newspaper opens to page 14.  Things happen alphabetically and by numbers.  Things happen in pairs and in threes.  Things happen under careful observation in scientific experiments inside white coated labs.  Things... unspeakable  things... happen outside bars at the end of a long drunken night.  Things happen to everyone all the time everyday all day long. Things are happening now.
