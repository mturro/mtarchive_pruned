# ! 'Whether you''re #tcot, tea party, liberal, democrat, republican - chances
  are you''re being f*d by Jamie Dimon'

<div class="Amp_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Post_Text"><p>There's not much to say about this... it makes me sick and more than just a little worried about where the path we're on may lead. What I find most worrisome isn't simply the amount of money being made by those at the top, but rather they way in which it has been steadily increasing and how its growth can be directly traced to and correlated with specific legislation. That Obama is just another in a line of Financial pawns is upsetting, but really not surprising. In the light of this kind of thing it really makes me scratch my head and wonder how people can get so partisan. Wake up folks - no - LOOK UP folks. We are being swindled.</p></div></div><div class=""><div class="Amp_Content_Outer"><div class="Amp_Top_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Source_First"><span>Amplify&rsquo;d from <a rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://robertreich.org/post/2325857692" href="http://robertreich.org/post/2325857692">robertreich.org</a></span></div></div><div class="Amp_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote class="Amp_Content_Item" cite="http://robertreich.org/post/2325857692"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div class="TxtCntnt"><div id="AutoGeneratedID-1">

<p>&#8220;If we&#8217;re going to strengthen our economy and grow jobs, this type of outreach &#8212; and cooperation between the administration, Congress, and the private sector &#8212; are critical,&#8221; says Dimon.</p>
<p>Dimon met last week with the President. Thirty other CEOs are meeting with him today.</p>
<p id="AutoGeneratedID-2">Dimon&#8217;s compensation over the last three years has averaged $21,991,394 a year. The tax deal agreed to between President Obama and the Republicans will give Dimon and extra $1,179,000 next year, according to an analysis by Citizens for Tax Justice.</p>
<p>The bank Dimon heads was also the beneficiary of the giant Wall-Street bailout of 2007 and 2008. JPMorgan Chase & Co, along with other Wall Street banks, also poured millions of dollars into a lobbying campaign to water down the financial reforms Congress considered earlier this year.</p>
