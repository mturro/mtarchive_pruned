# Thoughts on a lithiom ion death

The battery was low... as low as he'd ever seen it.  It was so low he wasn't sure that it could be brought back to life... so he just sat.  He sat and stared at the low battery, please wait message that replaced the normal screen.  He realized how much he had depended on it... now that it wouldn't work.  He realized that the energy he drew from it was fleeting, momentary, temporary, captured only to be released back into the universe and recycled through some mysterious process... a process understood by someone, but not by him.  He thought about his life... about how it was, how it would be without it... he thought about how he could possibly get by without the entertainment, the comfort, the convenience of it... he thought about the ways in which he was dependent on it, attached to it... he realized it was actually a part of him, a vital organ... and with its death he too would surely die.
