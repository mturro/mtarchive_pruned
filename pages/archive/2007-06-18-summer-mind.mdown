# summer mind

Perhaps he was just reaching his saturation point... nothing more could be extracted... nothing more could be released out into the acrid commute.  He had started this as an escape route for the torrent of images and ideas that he swam through everyday... a way to vent the thoughts generated by incoming information.... AND at first it was easy... at first he had no problem connecting... no problem entering the flow state... NOW it seemed like he had to work for every phoneme... every bit of sound.  It was sweat and exercise.  Summer mind he thought... heat... sun... summer... no time to think.  It's going to be a fight... all labor and hard work until the cool of September... THEN the mind will flow again.
