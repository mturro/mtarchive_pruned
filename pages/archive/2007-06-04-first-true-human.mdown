# first true human

When his life began people were tripping... not just a little... but crazy, inter-dimensional tripping that re-centered gravity.  Rockets were launched breeding extra-terrestrial footsteps... minds were blown to molecular pieces that seldom reformed in any way resembling their former state.... music... strange new electronic music bent and twisted and weaved through everything.  Sonic waves permeated hallucinatory social interactions and reality transformed from rock solid now into cosmic everywhere.  He became a part of it.  Another bit in the informational zeitgeist that swept through the landscape with the unforgiving grace of indigenous revenge.  He was native and alive... the result of a million years of unfolding code that had reached critical mass.  He was here, but somehow everywhere.  He could feel outside time... outside space... outside matter.  He was human... perhaps the first to be truly so.
