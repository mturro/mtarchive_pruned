# Beware the Printies

This is an accurate, kind of tongue-in-cheek look at a certain type of manager that exists, not only in the newspaper industry, but in the magazine world as well.  When you get right down to it I would imagine that this type of personality is prevalent in almost all industries.  No matter where you go or what business you're in you will run across somebody who just can't change.  Hell, even among the digital natives on Facebook you will find those who just can't handle change - look at the protest over the new FB design.  This fear is not generational - it's human - but it still needs to be overcome.
