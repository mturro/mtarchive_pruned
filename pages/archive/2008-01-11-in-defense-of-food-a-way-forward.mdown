Last year I had the good fortune to be given (as a gift from mom) the absolutely eye opening book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Omnivores-Dilemma-Natural-History-Meals/dp/0143038583/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1200105410&amp;sr=1-2">The Omnivore's Dilemma</a> by Michael Pollan.  This past week I blazed through his most recent book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1594201455/ref=nosim/librarythin08-20">In Defense of Food</a> which is to some extent an attempt to answer the dilemma posed in his previous work.  Among the many thoughtful approaches he gives for re-thinking our approach to food, one stands above all others as having tremendous potential to effect real change not just in our diets, but in our communities.  That is Community Supported Agriculture (CSA).  To break the hold of the supermarket... the monoculture... the feedlot... the antibiotics... the pesticides... the fertilizers... the chemical nightmare that is the industrial food chain... that may just be our best way forward.

This video profiles one of the CSA farms near where I live in Northern New Jersey. <a href="http://www.uppermeadowfarm.com">Upper Meadow Farm</a> is one of the many CSA farms that are working to change the way we relate to our food and the process by which it makes its way from the field to the table.  If I wasn't so lazy... if I wasn't so pounded by the beat of life... I would get off my ass and sign on right now.
