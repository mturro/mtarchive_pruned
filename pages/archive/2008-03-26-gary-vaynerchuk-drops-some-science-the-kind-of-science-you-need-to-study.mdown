# Gary Vaynerchuk drops some science, the kind of science you need to study.

I have been on the Gary Vaynerchuk bandwagon for a while now, and until recently I was just following his lead on wine. Lately though, <a href="http://twitter.com/garyvee">@garyvee</a> is really hitting a nerve in terms of plain old life.  His perspective has always been true... always been honest... always been about the things that matter. No bullshit, just good vibes and an unrepentant love of life and living.

In the video above he baselines the profound social and technological change we are living through and explains that the only sane way forward for business is transparency. That same sentiment is also the essence of what I'm trying to do on this blog... just be who I am, get everything out there, in plain sight.
