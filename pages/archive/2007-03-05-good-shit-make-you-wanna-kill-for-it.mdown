# Good shitâ€¦ make you wanna kill for it

Police are everywhere.  They live and breathe in the fog and in the end of the daylight... pink.  Cars, squads, clubs, orders, all string into one long chain of eventual crime... lifting all boats out of themselves and into the next new thing.  So you've never had the clams?  The only thing better than the clams are the mussels and they only have those every so often... I've been to 15 dinners here... retirements mostly.  But once back in '98 we honored this young kid who stopped a mugging on his first day.  Nothing really deserving of a dinner, but they had just  gotten a shipment of those mussels in and... god damn they're good.  An old lady... that's who was being mugged.  Some thirteen year old kid had heard that you could get really fucking high off of some Geritol-type of supplement that they gave away over and the Greenview senior center so he waited outside and got one of them old bags as she was coming from her refill.   Funny thing is she was beating the crap out of the kid when the cop showed up... would've killed him if the rookie didn't step in.  Good shit... make you wanna kill for it.
