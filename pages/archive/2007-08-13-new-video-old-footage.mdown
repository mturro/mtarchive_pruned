# new video old footage

Two excellent "new" videos from <a href="http://www.fuzzontheapple.com">William Mallory</a> -- a combination of his old film school footage and his new tunes.  Watching this stuff makes me remember how exciting it was to hang with Will back in the day... both he and his art were electric.  It made living in a small suburban New Jersey town feel like something closer to Greenwich Village.  Listening to the new tunes makes me wonder at the fact that he never let that excitement drain from his work... even as the vagaries of life might have forced him to.

<strong>Nevermore:</strong>
