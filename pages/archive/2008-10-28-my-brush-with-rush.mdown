# My Brush With Rush

Recently excommunicated Republican Christopher Buckley - writing at The Daily Beast - puts his finger on the growing rift between the head and heart of the GOP.  Reading this piece brought something home for me.  You see, I like to think of myself as an open minded, tolerant person who values difference of opinion as a tool of enlightenment.  I like to think that when confronted with an opinion that runs counter to mine I can at least respect it and - to some extent - ingest it and learn from it.  However, for the better part of the past decade, when confronted with "conservative" talking points I most often feel anger rather than curiosity - rage rather than resolution.  Now I understand why. They're not interested in learning or growing or evolving - they're only interested in winning.
