What were they talking about in the corner store in 1907?  It wasn't American Idol or The Apprentice or Fear Factor or Top Chef or Deal or no Deal or The Bachelor or The Girls Next Door or The Hills or The Real OC or Survivor or The Real World.  It wasn't Anna Nicole Smith or Lindsay Lohan or Tom Cruise or Paris Hilton or Tyra Banks or OJ Simpson.  It wasn't shark attacks or killer bees or hurricanes or TB or runaway brides... or runaway TB.  What could they have been talking about?  The weather I'm sure ...BUT...  Could they have been talking about issues?  Could they have been talking about things that had a direct effect on them and their lives?  Could they have been engaging in something approaching a civic dialogue?  Could they possibly have been, free from the burden of electronic distraction, tending to their democracy?  I don't know... what happened on TV last night?
