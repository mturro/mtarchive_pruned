# Hate Party

Douglas Rushkoff does it again.  His assessment of the RNC08 fundamentalist red meat pig out is spot on - it's something I was trying to grasp just this morning - Democrats are rational and Republicans are - there I stopped.  I had a hard time trying to put a word on what was happening in St.  Paul.  We obviously have a culture war here, but which cultures are at war?  Rushkoff sums it up best in this post: "Itâ€™s about thought vs. violence"  I'll leave it to you to figure out which party is which.
