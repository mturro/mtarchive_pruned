# Missing The Target

I was taking care of business at the Mad Hatter Saloon today (an afternoon Yankee game during the week) when I noticed this advertisement. On first blush it makes a lot of sense that this kind of "guy" movie would be targeted to the space above a urinal in the men's room of a bar, but on closer inspection I was perplexed to see the tagline: "What if this guy got you pregnant?"  What the fuck?  I mean how hard could it have been for whoever booked this space to realize that maybe there could be a better line to use here?  They had to have an idea... after all it's kind of an irregular size... shit, there may even be a standard "above urinal" size that would have given it away.  Is it laziness or just incompetence that this file wasn't amended to reflect the fact that it would be viewed almost exclusively by men?  I guess I'll never know... actually, I guess I just wanted to talk about "targeting" and urinals without sounding too disgusting.
