# reunion

It was green... the music... the memory... green.  Everything about it was still fresh with life as if it had in fact been only a few short hours earlier.  The years (decades actually) had been spent, but had not really lent themselves to distance... it was all right there... front forward.  The games, the grass, the sound of air pumped into an empty keg, the smell of stale beer, the brominated stench of used hot tub water... all right there. The ideas, emotions, uncertainty of youth RUSH like a liquid drug...  a line (a chord) relived... the suburban night sounds the same... still no charms for the restless dreaming youth... but warmer and filled with data.
