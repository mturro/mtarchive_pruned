# The Publishing Canary Theory Revisited

<p><a href="http://printceoblog.com/2009/01/the-publishing-canary-theory-revisited">The Publishing Canary Theory Revisited</a> - Magazine industry veteran and guru Bo Sacks checks in with this brief post at the Print CEO Blog on the rocky road ahead for the magazine industry.  Here is my comment, which I left at the scene: 

Bo, you keep hitting the nail right on the head, don&rsquo;t you? I share your hope that the industry will learn from the &ldquo;this moment of great attrition&rdquo; - and I think it will. It might take a while and a lot of good pubs will die, but there will be those that understand the times, understand the flows of digital information and how human interaction with that information is fundamentally new and different. It will be those folks who build the new models. It will be those folks who find the natural (and profitable) equilibrium between dots on a sheet and pixels on a screen. The only question I have is how many of those folks are out there right now working to make it happen?
