Creative people really jazz me. Joseph Arthur is a creative kat... a musician (a good musician who writes and sings weird, interesting, sublime, demented, twenty-first century psychedelic folk songs) and a painter (a pretty good painter who paints colorful, dissected, distracted, emotional, stringy, twenty-first century pop art) and now a man with a museum (of sorts). MOMAR is a space - a temporary space - in DUMBO Brooklyn that (according to the about page at <a href="http://www.museumofmodernarthur.com">http://www.museumofmodernarthur.com</a>) can, and will, party.  There are some other high minded bullet points on that page that attempt to ground the concept more firmly in artspeak, but really the place seems to be a celebration.  It's that sense of art as a conversation, a chat, a party that has pushed me into posting this (well, that and the fact that <a href="http://www.foxytunes.com/artist/joseph_arthur">Joseph Arthur's music</a> is hauntingly good).  So if you find yourself in DUMBO stop by and talk with some art.
