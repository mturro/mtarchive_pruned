# Detroit as the next great American artists colony.

<div class="Clog_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Clog_Post_Text"><p>Detroit has taken a beatingâ€” it&#8217;s essentially dead.  With median home prices hanging around used car territory much of the city&#8217;s real estate sits empty and decaying.  Jobs are few and far between.  When looked at through the prism of any traditional economic marker the situation is bleak. <br />
<br />
This is despair.<br />
This is darkness.<br />
This is poverty. <br />
This is art. <br />
Or at least the engine of art.<br />
<br />
To see what I mean - to see how what&#8217;s happening in Detroit is providing a fertile ecology for completely mind blowing art - to see how Detroit is the one true setting for the undiluted telling of the American story - click through to see more images like the ones below.<br />
<br />
Maybe it&#8217;s just me - just my over active imagination (I mean, I&#8217;ve never even been to Detroit) - but work like this is an indication that something is happening in that ghost of a city - something real. So keep an ear to Detroit&#8230; it&#8217;s saying something.<br />
