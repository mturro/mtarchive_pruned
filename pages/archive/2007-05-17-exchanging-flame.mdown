[GEARBOY56]:You stupid shit. the 344 NEVER had the killswitch in the firstplace!!!  They did away with that early in the development cycle of the 324... a good 3 YEARS before the 344 was even conceptualized....  [nodemaster]: OK -- if by killswitch you mean the actual switch, but I was making a finer point about the functionality of the killswitch... not the ACTUAL switch.  I guess reading these boards with only a third grade reading level inhibits comprehension of that kind of fine distinction... so sorry.  I'll try to be a little more straightforward from now on. [GEARBOY56]: Go fuck yourself.  [nodemaster]: Anatomically impossible you twit. [MODERATOR]: THIS DISCUSSION HAS BEEN DECLARED HOSTILE AND IS NOW CLOSED.
