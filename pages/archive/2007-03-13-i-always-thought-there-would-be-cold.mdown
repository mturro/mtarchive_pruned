# I always thought there would be cold

There are some things the police can't keep you safe from... like floating on the open ocean for 285 days. There's nothing that can prepare you for or save you from the effects of something like that. The endlessness of the ocean, the tiny insignificance of the soul, the reality of things comes rushing through you like good clean drugs.  Floating open and alone you feel the mind and the subconscious slowly becoming one... the convergence of cognitive and sub-cognitive processes distorts the previous held reality and bends physical space into non-linear, open-ended time. The undulation of liquid under your feet discloses itself... wavelengths, vibrations, strings, particles, physics itself plays within you as the mistaken ego evaporates into light.  Salt bleeds from the skin dripping hot.  Weakness leads to superhuman strength.  Humor fades. Laughter, or at least what it feels like to laugh, is everywhere.  There is no cold though... I always thought there would be cold.
