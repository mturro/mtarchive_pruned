# PC Magazine Goes 100% Digital

<p><a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2335009,00.asp">Another one bites the dust folks</a>.  And even though I am traditionally weary of the "digital edition" I am actually kind of excited to see what ZIFF and the PC Mag crew does with this format now that they are no longer tied to a print version. If they can manage to re-think the design and de-printify the overall feel of the book, then they might be on to something. If they just take the same layout files and simply change output settings they may be in for a rude awakening. In either case one thing is certain - things are changing daily&#8230; uh, hourly&#8230; well, by the minute it seems&#8230; so this is as good a bet as any other.
