# The ninth bell that never rings

Every wednesday at nine in the morning the clock would ring... eight times.  It is one of those things that the locals know about and to some extent take pride in knowing about, but the newbies really get thrown off by it... more so than you might imagine.  You would think that most people don't sit there and count how many times a clock rings and whether or not that number actually correlates to the time, but they do.  Not consciously, but almost everyone does.  Each Wednesday a local photographer sets up her camera in the park across from the clock and she captures the expressions that the incongruity creates.  People rushing to work... running to get to the office before that ninth bell chimes... the ninth bell that never rings.  They might think they have miscounted... or they might not have counted at all and just have a sense that something isn't quite right... but they always seem to notice.
