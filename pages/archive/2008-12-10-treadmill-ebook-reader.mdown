# Treadmill eBook Reader

<p><a href="http://www.ironicsans.com/2008/12/idea_treadmill_ebook_reader.html">Ironic Sans: Idea: Treadmill eBook Reader</a> - When  I see a good idea that should already be in operation somewhere I feel compelled to pass it on.  This one comes from photographer David Friedman and his blog Ironic Sans - and it really is a no brainer.  I especially love his name for it - though you'll just have to click through to his site to get that... I don't want to spoil it.
