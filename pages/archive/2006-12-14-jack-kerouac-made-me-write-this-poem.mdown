# “Jack Kerouac” Made Me Write This Poem

[coolplayer]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r4z8Zvo2PDw[/coolplayer]
something of the city builds inside as a lonely horn pines for the connection... the moment in the past... when we had something besides a plain future and instead saw everything with wild eyed color and deep depressed shadow. that me has gone leaving a strong scent of information and light for this one to cling to...

(mturro - NYC - 12/2006)
