This is a video by a couple of friends of mine. They go by the name of Charlie and they are good honest people making good honest art.  The video is a series of images... a slide show if you will.  The visuals... set to their original tune <strong>FUZZ ON THE APPLE</strong>... are a mix of photographs taken in and around New York City (and perhaps elsewhere) and original artwork.  You can learn more about Charlie, their art and their music by going to their site at <a href="http://fuzzontheapple.com">fuzzontheapple.com</a> or their myspace page at <a href="http://myspace.com/fuzzontheapple">myspace.com/fuzzontheapple</a>... and if you are in the NYC METRO area be sure to check them out live.
