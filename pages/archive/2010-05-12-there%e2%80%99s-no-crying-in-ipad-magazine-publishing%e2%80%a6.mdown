# There’s no crying in iPad magazine publishing…

<div class="Clog_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Clog_Post_Text"><p>Let&#8217;s be clear about something: this idea that magazine publishers are hesitant to get into a relationship with Apple because the publishers won&#8217;t be able to &#8220;control the consumer relationship&#8221; is essentially horse-shit.  <br />
<br />
While I&#8217;m not sure how many publishers are actually operating under that assumption (would not be surprised if it were an over done media meme), I am sure that those who are might as well pack up and go home now - they don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s happening and quite possibly never will.<br />
<br />
While it is true that the data that Apple provides about iTunes users is somewhat sparse it&#8217;s a cop-out to point to that as a flaw in the system. After all, how much does Vanity Fair know about the guy who paid cash for a copy of their rag at the train station? <br />
<br />
To the magazine publishers who do feel as if Apple somehow owes them more data I say this: grow a pair. This is the 21st century. We can do amazing things. We can start a million conversations today. We can know more about the folks reading our iPad editions than Apple does. We can get so deep into our reader&#8217;s social graphs that Apple will come asking us for data. <br />
<br />
So please stop thinking of your readers as numbers, names, addresses. These are people - talk to them. You may be surprised what there is to learn.<br />
<br />
[As a side note: I downloaded the Vanity Fair iPad edition and it is not revolting! It's fairly well done with appropriate room for improvement - pretty much what you expect at this stage in the game.]</p></div></div><div class="Clog_Content_Outer"><!-- BEGIN_CLOG_CONTENT ID: reload CLOGS.CLIPMARKS.COM --><div class="Clog_Top_Wrap"><div class="Clog_Source_First"><span>Clipped from <a rel="clipsource"  title="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/a-peek-at-vanity-fairs-ipad-app/" href="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/a-peek-at-vanity-fairs-ipad-app/">mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com</a></span></div></div><div class="Clog_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote class="Clog_Content_Item" cite="http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/05/11/a-peek-at-vanity-fairs-ipad-app/"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td>There are still unresolved questions about the iPad for publishers.
