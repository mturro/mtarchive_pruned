# Words written for nobody

I've written thousands of lines without ever having written something that has fundamentally changed anything or anyone.  I write and churn out half baked thoughts, immature ideas, untested theories, and overly complex notions of what it means to be human in this, the twenty-first century by the clock of some dead prophet.  And I am totally cool with that.  I don't need to be James Joyce... I'd bet James Joyce didn't need to be James Joyce... the recognition he enjoys is something that is secondary to the very act of producing language... the writer feels the need to explain his life, her experience... not to the world but, first and foremost, to himself... to myself.  So these words are written, not to win a prize or to effect a change or to get rich or win the love of some fair maiden... but to try and explain myself to myself... to try and find some sort of meaning not in the world as general experience but in my own narrow perception of it.
