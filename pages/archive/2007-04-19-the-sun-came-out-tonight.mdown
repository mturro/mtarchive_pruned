# The Sun Came Out Tonight

Whenever I start to think that this whole internet "user generated content" thing is an overblown, media-hyped mess of nonsense, something like this comes along and really, really sets me straight.  This video, by a couple of friends who go by the name of <a href="http://fuzzontheapple.com">charlie</a>, has struck a chord with me.  It's a trippy stop-motion pop gem that does a mind-blowingly good job at capturing the essence of life in the twenty-first century... life in fast forward.  But that's not even what really has me spinning... what I find truly fascinating here is the liberating effect of accessible technology and how it is empowering the modern, traditionally starving artist.  The REALLY exciting thing about this video is that these two, who have so little, can create something so profoundly, explosively good and in minutes have it in front of millions of potential viewers.
