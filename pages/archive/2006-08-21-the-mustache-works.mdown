# The Mustache Works

<img src="http://bluepear.org/images/giambistache.jpg" alt="giambi stache" class="left" />In honor of the Yankees 5-game sweep of the Red Sox I proudly post this picture of myself with a <a href="http://www.nj.com/sports/ledger/index.ssf?/base/sports-1/115596879592100.xml&amp;coll=1">Sal Fasano style mustache</a>.  The stache is obviously Photoshopped (not by me), but I can honestly tell you that I am wearing it in spirit on the streets of Manhattan everyday.  I hope all of you Yankee fans will follow the grand example set by Sal Fasano, Jason Giambi, Jaret Wright, Ron Villone and Johnny Damon... and grow yourself a mustache.  Or at least Photoshop one on.
