# Boehner, Birthers, and a parking lot in Arizona

<div class="Amp_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Post_Text"><p>John Boehner, as Speaker of the House, is now second in line for the highest office in the land. He is, as much as the President himself, a guiding voice in the great discussion that is American politics. When a person of that stature coddles demonstrably false notions, notions that in fact border on insanity, notions that in many ways are as divorced from reality and contemptuous of government as the incomprehensible and insane views of Jared Laughner, it not only degrades the chances of quality discussion, it stokes, validates, and grows the dark underbelly of psychopathic discontent flowing through American politics. <br />
<br />
Obviously the sort of violence and insanity that erupted in that parking lot in Arizona could be found even in societies that engage in the most measured and thoughtful discourse. Still, one can only wonder just how much a pervasive media environment soaked in the militaristic rhetoric of revolution, conflict, and violence fans the flames of that insanity.</p></div></div><div class=""><div class="Amp_Content_Outer"><div class="Amp_Top_Wrap"><div class="Amp_Source_First"><span>Amplify&rsquo;d from <a rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://www.hulu.com/watch/205165/nbc-nightly-news-with-brian-williams-boehner-on-birthers-hawaiis-word-good-enough-for-me" href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/205165/nbc-nightly-news-with-brian-williams-boehner-on-birthers-hawaiis-word-good-enough-for-me">www.hulu.com</a></span></div></div><div class="Amp_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote class="Amp_Content_Item" cite="http://www.hulu.com/watch/205165/nbc-nightly-news-with-brian-williams-boehner-on-birthers-hawaiis-word-good-enough-for-me"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><div align="center" class="Amp_Content_Item_Emb"><embed src="http://www.hulu.com/site-player/playerwrapper.swf?cb=2e64cd61L" height="329" width="400" wmode="opaque" quality="high" allowfullscreen="true"  allowscriptaccess="always"  bgcolor="#000000"  flashvars="bitrate=700000&user_id=-1&startLoadWrapperTime=1294581808290&overrideBrand=&referrer=http://www.hulu.com/watch/205165/nbc-nightly-news-with-brian-williams-boehner-on-birthers-hawaiis-word-good-enough-for-me&sortBy=&initMode=4&modes=4&content_id=50112056&cb=2011-1-9-14&v=3"  id="player"  name="player"  quality="high"  type="application/x-shockwave-flash" ></embed></div><span class="Amp_Source_Button"><a rel="clipsource" target="_blank" title="http://www.hulu.com/watch/205165/nbc-nightly-news-with-brian-williams-boehner-on-birthers-hawaiis-word-good-enough-for-me" href="http://www.hulu.com/watch/205165/nbc-nightly-news-with-brian-williams-boehner-on-birthers-hawaiis-word-good-enough-for-me">See more at www.hulu.com</a></span></td></tr></table></blockquote></div><div class="Amp_Bottom_Wrap">&nbsp;</div></div></div><div class="Amp_Link">See this Amp at <a href="http://bit.ly/fjhcy4">http://bit.ly/fjhcy4</a></div><br/>
