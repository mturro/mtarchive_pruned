# The importance of play

Some things your dog just can't save you from... some things are so undeniable, so necessary, that even a good and faithful mutt will not, cannot save you from having to experience it.  You just have to do it... to go through it... to get it done... roll with it... let it happen.  You have to decide to not fight it and just flow.  You must dive into it and accept its inevitability.  You have to forget about owning it... forget about claiming the process and just give yourself up to the cosmos... to fate... to chance... to blind, dumb, luck.  You must revel in your powerlessness... approach it organically... let it grow... deny artificiality... transcend materiality... green yourself in blissful surrender to its natural order. You must float mindlessly through its mystery and learn to enjoy its overriding emergence.  You must wade mindfully through its teachings and learn to decode and apply their underlying meaning.  And... most simply... most importantly... you must play through it... this life... you must play through it.
