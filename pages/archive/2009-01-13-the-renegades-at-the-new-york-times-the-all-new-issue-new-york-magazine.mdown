# The Renegades at the New York 'Times' - The All New Issue -- New York Magazine

<p><a href="http://nymag.com/news/features/all-new/53344/">The Renegades at the New York 'Times' -  New York Magazine</a> I know it's fashionable to trash the Times and make zealous proclamations on how the newspaper industry is as good as dead, but if newspapers are going to evolve it will be because of the work that folks like these guys at the NYT are doing.  I wouldn't be surprised in the least if in fifty years The New York Times brand is still relevant and wunderkind sites like Facebook are decades into a dirtnap.
