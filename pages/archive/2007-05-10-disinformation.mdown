There was an impossibly yellow truck sitting outside his apartment... it had been there for almost two days and the neighbors were starting to ask him questions.  He wanted to answer them... and sometimes did... with fabulous stories about how the truck was in fact outfitted with a detection system for airborne viruses and how he was the only person in the state certified to use it and that meant he had to take it home with him in case some sort of terrorist attack suddenly broke in the middle of the night... he told them that if they didn't see that truck that something was going down.  It wasn't long before Homeland Security took him away... for questioning.  They wanted to know just HOW the truck worked... WHO gave it to him... WHAT they were planning.  He told them that he was an operative for an organization that few have heard of... they numbered in the thousands and were growing everyday... soon their numbers would equal the entirety of the the US Armed Forces... soon they would make a play to control the media... then the food supply... then they would systematically take down the entire system in the name of... no not him... in the name of... he went silent... his eyes shifted to the floor... he made a few breathless sounds... he smiled... and then he died.  Within seconds the impossibly yellow truck disappeared.
