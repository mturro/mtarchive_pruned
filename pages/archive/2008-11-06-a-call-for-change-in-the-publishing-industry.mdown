# A Call For Change In The Publishing Industry

I love it when people from my industry (magazine publishing) take a good long critical look at what it is we're doing and how we might be able keep doing it.  In this post on his blog "A Photo Editor" Rob Haggart isn't pulling any punches.  While I may not agree with him to the letter I cannot agree more with hie overall theme: "Change or die. Itâ€™s up to you."
