# routine mission

The liftoff was rocky but it soon made sense.  There was little effort and no fanfare and that kind of made Wade feel better... nothing burned him more than screwing up in front of an audience.  He had settled into his chair and started taking the readings that needed to be taken in the first third.  Everything seemed normal.  After and hour he got up and made himself some freeze-dried ice cream (chocolate) and started the movie.  The face on the screen was familiar... the same face that had greeted him on every other mission he had ever undertaken... and it asked him to perform the usual operations and rundown the usual checklist and to make sure he had engaged the proper protocol on the machine.  The influx overflow option should... at this point.. be set and the temperature should be fixed and recorded.  Everything looked good.  Wade eased back in his chair and thought... too bad there isn't an audience.
