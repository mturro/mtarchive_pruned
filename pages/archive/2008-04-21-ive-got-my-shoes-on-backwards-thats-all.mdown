An interesting video by my friends William Mallory and Jessica Licciardello made it's way into my inbox today.  It's the video for the song <strong>"Shoes"</strong> (a catchy romp if there ever was one) off of William's latest album <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewAlbum?id=261486422&amp;s=143441">I was Never Here</a>.  If you like white rabbit LSD freakout visuals with a good pop music soundtrack, then this is your kind of video.  I'd love to hear the backstory on this.

New Jersey can feel that way sometimes.
