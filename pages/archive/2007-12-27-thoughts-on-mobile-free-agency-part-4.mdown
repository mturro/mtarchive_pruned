# Thoughts On Mobile Free Agency - Part 4

I wasn't planning on doing any posting until after the new year, but <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/12/26/gphone-to-debut-in-february/">this item caught my eye</a>.  It seems the timing of the release of an Android based Google phone perfectly coincides with my free agency ( if you don't know what I'm talking about see <a href="http://mturro.bluepear.org/tag/mobile/">the first three parts of this series</a>).  As I have said I am 90% sure I'm going iPhone, but things are so turbulent in the mobile world right now that I can't really be sure what happens.  One thing is certain though... it looks like I'm going to have a nice healthy field of choices come February.  Happy New Year everyone!
