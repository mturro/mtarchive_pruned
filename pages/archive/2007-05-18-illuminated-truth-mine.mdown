# illuminated truth mine

Along the long runway illuminated creatures move and sense the night has taken them as far as it can.  They slip into their holes and wait for the punishing sun to take its place at the head of the corporate day. They had been mining all night and still nothing... still no sign of the elemental truth that they knew was hidden somewhere in the thickening layers of manufactured national reality. The world was still in the same stupid way it was when they began.  Children were still starving in the field where everything was born... the transformed were still resolute in their empty but profitable sidelines... and the pious still held tightly to the myth that only they continued to believe. Without the truth nothing can change... at least not in the way the creatures of the night had wanted it to.  No matter... when the sun goes down they'll have at it again... that's what they do.  Perhaps tonight, in the comforting grace of darkness, they'll find the truth.
