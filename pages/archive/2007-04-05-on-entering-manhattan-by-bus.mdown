# On entering Manhattan by Bus

I am starting this at 8:26 am eastern time.  I am sitting on a bus bound for the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan and trying like hell not to get annoyed by the row of suburban housewives who just sat down in front of me. It's unfair I know, but there's just something about daytrippers, holiday shoppers, resident tourists, that really kind of bothers me.  Perhaps it's the fact that they live within spitting distance of the most vibrant city to ever spew CO2 into the atmosphere and never bother to take advantage of it... never bother to let it happen to them.  Instead they regulate their interaction with it... limit themselves to the annual shopping spree, or Broadway musical.  They never go in a whim... they must plan months in advance... take time off from their deathly gray cubes... make arrangements for the kids... think about dinner.  I guess it's not totally their fault... they are products of the machine in the same way I am.  Maybe that's what gets me... they represent the limitations of us all.  I am ending this at 8:35 am eastern time.  I am still sitting on a bus bound for the Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan and trying like hell to fight the nausea.
