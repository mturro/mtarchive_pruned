# Donâ€™t cry for journalists...

This short and sweet post from Scoble does a great job at pointing out the amazing amount of inefficiency that pervades the media world.  For me it&#039;s not as much about the fact that some of these photographers could be used on other stories as it is about the fact that the media wastes an inordinate amount of capital on overblown infrastructure.  In the end I would bet that somewhere behind that crowd of $10,000 lenses is a kid with a cell phone camera getting the most compelling picture in the arena.
