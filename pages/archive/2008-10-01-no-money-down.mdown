# No Money Down

Finally somebody is making sense!  Douglas Rushkoff, in this article for Arthur Magazine cross-posted to his blog, does something I've been waiting to see done for a while now - he explores just how the credit industry has taken advantage of the unwitting consumer.  He tells of behavioral finance and its purposefully arcane concepts like “money illusion bias,” “loss aversion theory,” “irrationality bias,” and “time discounting.”  He tells the story of just how this credit trap was set, and just how it now coming to be sprung and just who is going to profit and who is on the hook.  While it is exciting to watch the Dow jump up and down, the real story here is the credit markets and the lending practices that have made Joe Sixpack fair game - hopefully we'll start to hear some of this coming from the stump and the halls of Congress.
