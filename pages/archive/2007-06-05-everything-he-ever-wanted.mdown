# everything he ever wanted

The pressure was hardly bearable.  It held him down and kept him coldly aware that his life had been, up to now, a sham.  The early morning meetings, the late afternoon lunches, the cocktail hours, the theatre, the dinners... all of it was neatly designed to sell.  He thought of the times before he became this person... the times before he was toasted and photographed and fully and brutally socialized.  He thought of the windows on the family car and how they would streak with rain.  He would sit silently watching the streaks run in patterns across the glass as the roadways and landscape of the nation slid by in background.  Now, in front of this window, with this rain streaking across this glass, he couldn't manage to stop.  He couldn't help but look out through the patterns on the glass and into his own eyes hanging high above the city flushed with the bright white light of advertising space.  This was life to him now... all plastic and thin. He had become a series of colored dots... pixels in an image.  As he closed his eyes he tried to feel the dark of the room... the silence... he listened and thought he could hear the sound of a heartbeat... his heartbeat... faint and distant and receding further from shore.
