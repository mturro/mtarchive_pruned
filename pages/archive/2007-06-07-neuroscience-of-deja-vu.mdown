Seriously though, I have had some very strong episodes and the "someplace similar" explanation doesn't quite explain them for me.  For instance how does this explain those moments when I'm sitting in my dining room, talking  to my mother-in-law about something and all of a sudden I KNOW I have lived this before.  this isn't an "overlapping blueprint" it's an existing one.

Strange place the brain...</p><p>
