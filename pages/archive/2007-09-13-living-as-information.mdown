# Living As Information

He opened himself up for it... there is no doubt about that.  He just seemed so clueless, so current, so god-damned full of all the bullshit that you just shouldn't be full of if you want people to take anything you say seriously.  Yet people clung to him - to his every word - to his most trivial posts - to his dumbest tweets - and contemplated them with either extreme fascination or wild contempt.  His data flowed and churned and looped into readers and aggregators and pod-catchers by the thousands... the tens of thousands.  He had followers and friends that seemed to multiply in exponential ways until they formed massive networks of love and hate.  He was, without a doubt, a product of the time... a man, a life, living as information.
