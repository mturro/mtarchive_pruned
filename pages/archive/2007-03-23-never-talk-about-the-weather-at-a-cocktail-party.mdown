# Never talk about the weather at a cocktail party

There was a troubling mist that crept through the towns and highways of the north.  It carried with it the sense of calm that comes from realizing that there are no longer any options... any choices to be made.  It enveloped the cars and trucks and buses and trains in its simplicity; it obscured the sunlight and dipped a low hanging and wet warmth into the otherwise thankful Friday.  Weekend plans were fixed firmly in the minds of the workforce and the soft lap of Spring felt strange and, for some reason, unnatural to them. They had been toiling all week... no all Winter... inside a state of meteorological flux  and they just couldn't bring themselves to trust weather anymore.  At some point... nobody quite remembers when... it (the weather) traded in its status as a predictable, common, banal, point of conversation for a new and complicated status as a heated, impassioned, vibrant political and scientific cause.  Yes it seemed that for the foreseeable future the workforce, at least the socially graced among them, would be expounding a new axiom: cultured, mannered, civilized people... DO NOT TALK ABOUT THE WEATHER IN POLITE CONVERSATION!
