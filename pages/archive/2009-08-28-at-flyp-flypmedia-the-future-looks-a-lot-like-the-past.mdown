# At Flyp - @flypmedia - the future looks a lot like the past

<div class="Clog_Commentary_Wrap"><div class="Clog_Post_Text"><p>This is the second time in the last few weeks that I&#8217;ve seen Flyp - an online Flash heavy magazine - be touted as the &#8220;future&#8221; of storytelling or magazines or publishing.  Makes me wonder what these folks are smoking. Anyway - I figured I&#8217;d post up the comment I left over at Mediashift after reading yet another silly &#8220;future of&#8221; post. (For clarity&#8217;s sake: I like Flyp - good compelling editorial, great design, nice mix of music, video, animation - I just don&#8217;t see it as the future or a break from the past.  It&#8217;s simply the same skeleton wrapped in digital flesh.)<br />
<br />

<br />
The future of online storytelling? Hardly. If anything Flyp is rooted firmly in the traditional, linear, editorial, top-down, command and control style of storytelling. That command and control structure may be slightly different, but it is, without a doubt, of the past.<br />
<br />
A &#8220;magazine&#8221; that seeks to exemplify the future of storytelling has to do more than simply update the way it presents the same old authorial/editorial paradigm. It&#8217;s not enough to take some Flash and some video and put it on the web and call it the future. It may work on some level, and people will find it engaging (I do), but it is simply not indicative of the informational paradigm shift that is underway. As such it will be limited as to the resonance it might have. Flyp is - at it&#8217;s essence - not of now.<br />
<br />
The true measure of the modern story is the degree to which we (the people formerly known ad the readers) can use/mix/add/subtract/move/share/alter it. The real marker of an emerging narrative is how open it is, how it lives after publication, how it evolves and grows inside a living media ecology. While Flyp is a nice looking piece of media it simply fails in its ability to facilitate any of that activity.</p></div></div><div class="Clog_Content_Outer"><!-- BEGIN_CLOG_CONTENT ID: 8C0A48DE-F460-4F5B-B0FF-D2109A3F683B CLOGS.CLIPMARKS.COM --><div class="Clog_Top_Wrap"><div class="Clog_Source_First"><span>Clipped from <a rel="clipsource"  title="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2009/08/magazines-need-to-embrace-multimedia-storytelling-in-digital-age239.html" href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2009/08/magazines-need-to-embrace-multimedia-storytelling-in-digital-age239.html">www.pbs.org</a></span></div></div><div class="Clog_Middle_Wrap"><blockquote class="Clog_Content_Item" cite="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2009/08/magazines-need-to-embrace-multimedia-storytelling-in-digital-age239.html"><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td><P>The fact that these media all co-exist in a form that&#8217;s ubiquitous and becoming more mobile all the time suggests that it&#8217;s manifest destiny, it&#8217;s not a passing fancy. Life magazine, which I used to edit, started with photography, it started with a media form. Different kinds of storytelling follow available and compelling media. That&#8217;s how television started, how radio started. I don&#8217;t pretend to know all the forms it will take because the future will tell us that, and reader reactions will tell us that. As the platforms become ubiquitous, this kind of storytelling will become dominant.<SPAN></SPAN><SPAN></SPAN></P><span class="Clog_Source_Button"><a rel="clipsource"  title="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2009/08/magazines-need-to-embrace-multimedia-storytelling-in-digital-age239.html" href="http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2009/08/magazines-need-to-embrace-multimedia-storytelling-in-digital-age239.html">Read more at www.pbs.org</a></span></td></tr></table></blockquote></div><div class="Clog_Bottom_Wrap">&nbsp;</div></div>
