# Steven Johnson makes excellent points in defense of “hipster” parents

Steven Johnson has <a href="http://www.stevenberlinjohnson.com/2007/02/some_close_read.html">an excellent post on his blog</a>... it's a "close" reading (I love that phrase... haven't really used it since grad school) of a David Brooks column on hipster parents.  Johnson's characterization of Brooks' column as "breathtakingly superficial" is good medicine for those of us who, for whatever reason, have tried to maintain some connection to the life we had lead up to the point of conception of our first child.  While Johnson's most interesting point doesn't wholly apply to my situation... he is more interested by the trend of urban child rearing... it does do a  great job of knocking the legs out from under a pompous piece that is little more than a button down tight-ass assault on what its author sees as a silly, style hungry, left leaning, trend of <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20070120.LEAH20%2FTPStory%2FTPEntertainment%2F&amp;ord=1172515592206&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true">alternaparenting</a>.
