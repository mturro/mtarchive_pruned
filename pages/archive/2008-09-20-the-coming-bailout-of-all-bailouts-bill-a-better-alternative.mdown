# ! 'The Coming Bailout of All Bailouts Bill: A Better Alternative'

Robert Reich is a small man with a big mind.  Clinton's former Secretary of Labor is now an Obama economic adviser and also a really interesting blogger.  I've been addicted to his posts during the past few months but now that the focus - everybody's focus - switches to the economy he becomes required reading.  In this post he outlines a common sense approach to bailouts - among other things, he favors letting the executives of these failing companies feel some pain.  I like the sound of that.
