# Spielberg’s Munich

I finally had the opportunity to see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_%28film%29">Munich</a> last night and I have to say that the film really stayed with me.  Certainly the subject matter is haunting and the clandestine operations of various intelligence agencies is a curious context, yet this film has much more than just great spy punch.  It is undoubtedly the first movie made since 2001 that really explores the nature of the worldwide bloodshed we are currently living through.  By keeping away from black and white good and evil portrayals <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg">Spielberg</a> provides an excellent commentary on the â€œwith us or against usâ€ mentality that has so tragically gripped policy making in the last five years.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_%28film%29">Munich</a> does not try to be a historical document and warns the viewer that the story is in fact only â€œinspiredâ€ by actual events.  In taking artistic license rather than attempting to patch together the memories of necessarily sketchy and shadowy figures or snippets of declassified and redacted documents <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Spielberg">Spielberg</a> and writers <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Kushner">Tony Kushner</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eric_Roth">Eric Roth</a> are able to truly delve into the social and personal ramifications of â€œeye for an eyeâ€ response policies.  Ultimately though, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_%28film%29">Munich</a> raises more questions that it answers... and that is the film's most powerful aspect.
