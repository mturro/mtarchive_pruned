# The Unbearable Lightness of Art Supplies

Khoi Vinh, Design Director for NYTimes.com, misses the touch, feel, smell, and maybe even taste of old school art supplies.  Since he&#039;s now a twenty first century digital boy he doesn&#039;t have occasion to use the exacto anymore... and he seems sad.  To be fair he&#039;s really more sad at what he perceives as a gap between where he is now and where he was in art school - a divide between print and digital design which he seems to think makes the two distinctly different professions.  What he&#039;s not seeing though is the degree to which the design process, no matter where it may end, is becoming increasingly digital.  In other words, that divide is closing.  In a few short years we&#039;ll have an art department that is completely digital - a design group that thinks in bits and bytes and ink on paper will just be one of the many possible manifestations of that process.  So don&#039;t worry Khoi - we&#039;ll all be  shopping in the same store soon.
