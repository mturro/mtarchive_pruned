# Can the human now find harmony with the cosmic now?

It's changing... everything is changing. Global highs have been grouped neatly with record lows and the cyclical rhythm of nature has yielded to a chaotic flurry of novelty and extremes.  Dependability is out the window and there is no longer time left for poetry, reflection, philosophy, or (least of all) consumerist ideals of a utopian growth based economy.  We have stepped into the next big thing only to realize that the next big thing is really not a thing but a choice... a choice between the logic and balance of happiness or the groping need of gluttony.  The human mix is face to face with the sort of fork from which rifts in time-space are born... one path leading into a certain future of individualistic want, the other into a field of green communal interoperability.  It may be psychologically feasible to follow both, to move forward consciously on one as the subconscious silently follows along the other.  As "reality" moves ahead it accesses information from both paths, remixes both experiences, mashes the logical extensions of both ideologies into the human now... leading us to the ultimate question: can the human now find harmony with the cosmic now?
