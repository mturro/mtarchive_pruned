# Bush Turns to Big Military Contractors for Border Control

Yes, George W. Bush is in office to make as much money for his defense contractor friends as he possibly can.  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/18/washington/18border.html?ex=1305604800&amp;en=992b6fb4a7a4ed61&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss">This article from the New York Times</a> proves it.  What's next... Bush turns to big military contractors for education plan?  Really now... is there any issue that this guy doesn't see as being solvable through some sort of militaristic deployment of weaponry, technology, or other expensive bone for his cronies?
