# OK is not OK

<p><a href="http://www.spd.org/2009/01/ok-is-not-ok.php">OK is not OK</a> - This piece by Fortune Magazine Photo Director Greg Pond, posted to the blog of the Society of Publication Designers (SPD), is nothing short of brilliant. In fact it could be taken as something of a manifesto - words I would readily and enthusiastically sign my name to.  As I wrote in the comments section on the post - of all the things that MIGHT save print, creativity is the least discussed and perhaps the most effective tool we have at our disposal.  If print media is to survive, if magazines are to survive, they MUST be interesting - they must take chances.
