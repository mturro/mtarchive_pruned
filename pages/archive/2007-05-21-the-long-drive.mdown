# the long drive

He let the needle drop lightly onto the groove and imagined the cars on the other side of the wall becoming traffic.  The cigarette lighters now all fueling electronic daydreams, the radio dead and long gone, the lights now smarter than they were when he was young... this is the road today.  Telephonic distractions creep throughout.  Climate controlled escape pods navigate the uncontrolled climate, protecting then fragile cargo from harsh reality.  News and weather at five past the hour... things like advertisements line the highway prophetic and stark against the dying sunlight... another mile another ten dollar ransom. Tankers breeze alongside high on the gulf-stream and important in their own spectacular way.  Vacation... summer vacation... the long and somber summer vacation where petroleum bleeds into concrete and nitrates invade the unsuspecting bloodstream.  We are all on our way... driving... burning... heading... somewhere.
